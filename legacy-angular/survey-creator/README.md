# SurveyJS Survey Creator for Angular

## SurveyJS for Angular 12+
If you use **Angular 12+**, use the native SurveyJS Angular integration and use the [survey-creator-angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-creator-angular) package. For more information and examples of usage, refer to:
* Demo: [SurveyJS Survey Creator | Angular](https://surveyjs.io/survey-creator/examples/free-nps-survey-template/angular)
* Documentation: [Add Survey Creator / Form Builder to an Angular Application](https://surveyjs.io/survey-creator/documentation/get-started-angular)

## Survey Creator and Form Library for Angular 8+
This example uses the Survey Creator Knockout integration (the [survey-creator-knockout]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/survey-creator-knockout)) package) to integrate SurveyJS Survey Creator to an Angular 8 application. Also, this example integrates Form Library into the same app. It's important to note that in this configuration, Form Library also uses the Knockout integration.
